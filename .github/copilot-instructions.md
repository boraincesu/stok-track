- [x] Verify that the copilot-instructions.md file in the .github directory is created. (Created initial instructions file.)

- [x] Customize the Project (Added Prisma schema, NextAuth config, Supabase envs, signup/login UI, and protected dashboard.)

- [x] Install Required Extensions (No extensions specified in setup info.)

- [x] Compile the Project (Ran `npm run lint` and `npm run build`.)

- [x] Create and Run Task (Not required for this Next.js setup.)

- [ ] Launch the Project (Awaiting user confirmation to run the dev server.)

Execution Guidelines

- Track progress in the todo list and update it after each completed step.
- Keep communication concise and avoid dumping full command output unless asked.
- Work from the project root and only create new folders when absolutely necessary.
- Install only the extensions listed in the setup info.
- Focus on purposeful features, prompt for clarification when requirements are ambiguous.
- Consider the task finished once scaffolding, docs, and launch guidance are ready.
